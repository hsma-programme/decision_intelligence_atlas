Welcome to the Healthcare Services Analytics & Decision Science Atlas. **This is a directory of open-source tools, packages, and projects for analytics and decision science in healthcare.**

This site is in its very early stages - please check back as we continue to develop it.

In time, we hope this can develop into a tool to help showcase the amazing work happening across the analytics and data science communities in healthcare, promoting reuse and collaborative work on the tools we all need.
