    "section": "",
    "text": "pm4py is a library for process mining in Python.\nProcess mining uses event logs - logs recorded during processes like moving through a healthcare pathway - to discover, monitor, and improve real-world processes. Event logs typically record “who did what, when,” allowing organizations to visualize workflows, identify bottlenecks, and verify whether operations follow intended procedures.\npm4py also supports conformance checking, comparing event logs to reference models to detect deviations, and performance analysis, revealing inefficiencies such as delays or rework loops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\npm4py’s licencing terms are quite restrictive compared to some other packages. Note that you can only use this in closed-source projects if you pay for a licence. If the code using pm4py is released open source under the AGPL licence, no costs apply at the time of writing (November 2025). This information is available at processintelligence.solutions/pm4py#licensing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe R equivalents of this package are bupaR (which has its own buparverse including the ability to animate process mining outputs), and the R package pm4py, which provides an interface to the predictive functionality of pm4py in the R world.\n\n\n\nYou can try the package out in this web app, though you should not upload any real data. A sample dataset is provided.\n\n\n    \n        Open the App in a new window\n        View the App Code"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nowcasting combines statistical modelling with real-time data to estimate current levels of activity when complete information is not yet available. Originally used in fields like economics and epidemiology, it also has potential application in healthcare operations.\nThis script was used during the COVID-19 pandemic. In it, nowcasting methods were used to predict near-term hospital admissions and bed occupancy despite delays in data reporting. By accounting for those delays, nowcasting provided more accurate, up-to-date estimates of system pressure than raw data alone. This approach supports operational planning and resource allocation, helping healthcare teams respond proactively to emerging trends rather than reacting to outdated figures.\nWhile it is a comparatively simple approach with its limitations, it does have its uses. A full read of the paper is recommended to understand this method and whether it is suitable for your use case, or whether alternative forecasting options would be better suited to the problem at hand."
