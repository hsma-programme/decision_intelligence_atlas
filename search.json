Event logs typically record “who did what, when,” allowing organizations to visualize workflows, identify bottlenecks, and verify whether operations follow intended procedures.\npm4py also supports conformance checking, comparing event logs to reference models to detect deviations, and performance analysis, revealing inefficiencies such as delays or rework loops."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nowcasting combines statistical modelling with real-time data to estimate current levels of activity when complete information is not yet available. Originally used in fields like economics and epidemiology, it also has potential application in healthcare operations.\nThis script was used during the COVID-19 pandemic. In it, nowcasting methods were used to predict near-term hospital admissions and bed occupancy despite delays in data reporting. By accounting for those delays, nowcasting provided more accurate, up-to-date estimates of system pressure than raw data alone. This approach supports operational planning and resource allocation, helping healthcare teams respond proactively to emerging trends rather than reacting to outdated figures.\nWhile it is a comparatively simple approach with its limitations, it does have its uses. A full read of the paper is recommended to understand this method and whether it is suitable for your use case, or whether alternative forecasting options would be better suited to the problem at hand."

This is a directory of open-source tools, packages, and projects for analytics and decision science in healthcare.\nThis site is in its very early stages - please check back as we continue to develop it.\nIn time, we hope this can develop into a tool to help showcase the amazing work happening across the analytics and data science communities in healthcare, promoting reuse and collaborative work on the tools we all need.\nContributions are very welcome! Please see the repository README for instructions on how to contribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease note that inclusion of a tool on this site does not imply that the HSMA team have reviewed these tools in detail. This is designed to act as a signpost to the work out there, and provide a high-level indication of the health of any given project, but you should always conduct your own reviews of the suitability of any of these tools and techniques for your own use case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have any concerns, or would like any content to be removed, please contact Sammi Rosser."

It uses the most recently produced GP Registered Practice Populations as well as the weighted populations calculated from the Allocation model for each of its components. More information on the Allocations process, as well as useful documentation can be found at https://www.england.nhs.uk/allocations/\nThe tool allows a new ‘place’ to be defined in an ICB as a cluster of GP practices. This allows place to be flexibly defined, whether that is as GP practices in the same Primary Care Network (PCN), Local Authority, or that feed into the same Secondary services for example. That is at the discretion of the ICB. Once GP practices have been allocated to a place, the relative need indices can be calculated and the output can be downloaded as a CSV.” (source)"
