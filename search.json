    "text": "Streamlit allows users to create interactive Python-based web apps, making it easier for non-technical users to interact with insights generated by Python code without having to interact with code files or - depending on how the app is eventually deployed - without having Python installed on their machine.\nBelow is an example of a Streamlit interface created to allow users to run a discrete event simulation model, where they can change parameters and rerun the simulation without ever changing the parameter in a script.\nWith even relatively complex apps achievable with only Python code, simple top-to-bottom execution of code by default, and inbuilt support for common data analysis outputs like interactive dataframes, static and interactive plots, and maps, it’s a powerful but beginner friendly tool that also can be used for complex apps with its advanced state management and rerun control features."

    "text": "Related projects\nThe stlite project makes it possible to convert existing Streamlit apps into pyodide-based web apps. Using modern web-assembly technology, this executes the Python code in the user’s browser, removing the need for a traditional server to run your web app. This can be particularly helpful if you expect to have large numbers of people accessing a site simultaneously.\nThe stlitepack package complments this, removing the manual effort involved with converting Streamlit apps to stlite apps.\nIf you are looking to make web apps in R, you will find the R Shiny project to be up your street.\nIf you are familiar with Shiny but are now looking to write web apps in Python, you may prefer Shiny for Python.\nOther Python-based web app technologies aimed at analysts and data scientists, such as Plotly Dash, are available.\nFor more complex websites, you may need to consider advanced Python web frameworks such as Flask Django, though these require significant additional work and skills in frontend development - exhaust the options above before settling on this!\nIf you don’t want a front end, but just need a way to access the results of calculations based on an input (such as getting predictions from a trained machine learning model using an input)"

    "section": "Deployment",
    "text": "Deployment\nStreamlit apps can be run locally on the machine of a user with Python installed, allowing for the creation of an easier-to-use interface for certain tasks. This is usually achieved by downloading/cloning the GitHub repository where the app is stored, installing the relevant environment, and running the app with a command like streamlit run app.py, which should be detailed in the repository readme.\nIn these cases, all processing will happen on the machine of the user running the app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt’s important to consider the security of any Streamlit app you download from GitHub - or any script in general!\nWhile it’s not practical or necessary to review every line of code you ever use - for example, you woudn’t be expected to check every line in a pandas or matplotlib function before running it - you should consider whether undertaking some review of code is sensible. A large library that’s been thoroughly reviewed by the wider open source community? Risks are very low. But while it’s very rare, it is possible for a malicious actor to write commands into the code that would send data from the memory of an app - such as uploaded data or database credentials - to an external location. For smaller apps, scripts or libraries, you should consider some review of the code for any obvious potentially unsafe code.\nIn particular, keep an eye out for the use of libraries like requests, urllib, smtp, sqlite, socket, subprocess or shutil. While these may be used entirely legitimately - e.g. to request publicly held data from a website or an API, or to undertake necessary filesystem operations for accessing and saving data locally - you should review any use of these libraries and make sure you understand what they are doing.\n\n\n\nCloud\nVarious free options for cloud-based deployment of Streamlit apps exist. This can be a strong option for apps using publicly accessible data, sufficiently aggregated data, and other data that has been deemed to be not sensitive.\n\nTraditional Streamlit Apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll free deployment options will involve processing of uploaded or linked data on third party servers, which may not be located in the UK and will not have been audited/approved by your organisation for processing of data.\nIt is crucial that you do not upload, or encourage users to upload, real individual-level data or otherwise sensitive data.\n\n\nStreamlit Community Cloud: This free option allows for apps to be hosted, though they will go to sleep after a relatively short timeout of 12 hours. Users will be presented with a screen which will allow them to ‘wake the app up’, which may take a few minutes. There are limits on the memory allocated to your app, which\nPosit Connect Cloud: This alternative, run by Posit (who are behind RStudio and other tools), has a free tier that allows you to publish Streamlit apps (among other things).\nThere are also various enterprise-level versions of cloud deployment which may be secure options for more sensitive data (if your organisation is willing to fund this).\nFor example, Posit Connect Cloud offers various enterprise-grade tiers. Other options include snowflake, which is the company that owns Streamlit, and plotly dash enterprise. The author of this entry believes all three options have been used by NHS trusts or related bodies for app deployment and/or report automation, though is unable to confirm this.\n\n\nServerless (stlite) apps\nServerless apps, such as those created with stlite/stlitepack, still require a server to host the static page. Various free hosting options exist for this.\nGitHub Pages: this free option is closely integrated with GitHub.\nAn example repository that does thi, along with using a custom URL, can be found at https://github.com/hsma-programme/Teaching_DES_Concepts_Streamlit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn theory, data uploaded to a pyodide-based web app does not leave the user’s PC, and all processing is handled locally (i.e. on their machine).\nIn practice, we do not have a robust policy or evidence to support whether the processing of sensitive data on pyodide/web-based apps is fully safe, so it should not be considered an appropriate solution at this time.\nA key exception to this is the stlite-quarto extension - allowing embedding of interactive apps directly within quarto without external hosting - which will process the code externally.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease always speak to your IT, data engineering or internal app/software department before doing any of the below.\n\n\nLocal deployment is possible as well on a server owned by your organisation, allowing the app to be run safely and securely in a manner that’s only accessible to users within your organisation, and in a way that means all data processing happens on internally-owned and managed compute resource.\nYou may find Streamlit’s guidance on deployment to be of use; they strongly recommend the use of Docker if going down the local deployment route. This can be combined with Kubernetes to manage auto-scaling of the number of running containers to manage changes in the number of people accessing the app simultaneously, so your users won’t experience issues with accessing the app or their requests running in a timely manner.\nStrictly speaking you could avoid Docker and just run it in the normal way (streamlit run myapp.py) and users on your local area network access it via the relevant port that is shown in the terminal - see e.g. https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/deploying-streamlit-app-in-internal-network-using-network-url/41004/2. This isn’t intuitive, robust, or safe enough though!\nRegardless, you should set up a reverse proxy with a technology like nginx to allow users to access it via a more intuitive URL - so instead of entering something like http://192.168.1.5:8501, they can type http://data-science-app.com. Crucially, the reverse proxy is a key part of configuring transport layer security (TLS/SSL), ensuring that all content is served over a secure connection that cannot be intercepted and decoded. Seen a little padlock icon next to a URL (which will also start with https instead of http) in your browser on sites where you enter your payment details? That’s SSL. This is often a mandatory part of setting up even internal apps.\nStreamlit’s guidance FAQs include key details about getting your app to appear when a particular web address is entered and hosting multiple apps on a single server.\nYou may also need to consider authentication or access restriction - if different user groups need access to different levels of data, this is something you will have to manage within Streamlit using its inbuilt authorization methods and features such as session state.\nIf you are simply able to restrict access to the app to certain user groups, your IT department may be able to help with this from a server perspective through the use of Active Directory or something similar.\nYour IT department may also prefer to consider - if budget is available - a solution such as posit connect, which can make deployment and maintenance of Streamlit and other apps or APIs a more streamlined experience for analysts and data scientists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe are keen to hear of success stories within the NHS of people who have successfully obtained a server, virtual machine or similar to deploy apps on within an organisation. Please get in touch via the issues page or submit a pull request with additional information in this section!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe free eBook devops for data science may help you speak the language of your IT team."

    "text": "Nowcasting combines statistical modelling with real-time data to estimate current levels of activity when complete information is not yet available. Originally used in fields like economics and epidemiology, it also has potential application in healthcare operations.\nThis script was used during the COVID-19 pandemic. In it, nowcasting methods were used to predict near-term hospital admissions and bed occupancy despite delays in data reporting. By accounting for those delays, nowcasting provided more accurate, up-to-date estimates of system pressure than raw data alone. This approach supports operational planning and resource allocation, helping healthcare teams respond proactively to emerging trends rather than reacting to outdated figures.\nWhile it is a comparatively simple approach with its limitations, it does have its uses. A full read of the paper is recommended to understand this method and whether it is suitable for your use case, or whether alternative forecasting options would be better suited to the problem at hand."
