Welcome to the Healthcare Services Analytics & Decision Science Atlas.

This site is in its very early stages - please check back as we continue to develop it.

In time, we hope this can develop into a tool to help showcase the amazing work happening across the analyics and data science communities in healthcare, promoting reuse and collaborative work on the tools we all need.

Contributions are very welcome!

This process will be streamlind in the future, but for now you can [take a fork of the repository](https://github.com/hsma/decision_intelligence_atlas) and then make a pull request with your proposed additions or changes.
