These are tools that are primarily used via a graphical interface or web browser, so people can work with them directly without needing to edit or run code.

In this atlas, anything you would normally treat as "code you work on" (e.g., R Shiny apps distributed with their source code) should be listed under their underlying language (e.g. R).
