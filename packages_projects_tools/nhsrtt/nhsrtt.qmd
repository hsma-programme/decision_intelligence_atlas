    NHSRtt is an R package, providing analysts with a simple stock-and-flow modelling framework for NHS referral-to-treatment (RTT) data. The tool supports scenario testing and planning for elective care pathways by translating patient flow data into projections of waiting list size and treatment demand.

The tool supports scenario testing and planning for elective care pathways by translating patient flow data into projections of waiting list size and treatment demand.

The tool uses entirely publically available data, and is currently updated with new data once a month.

The core idea is to implement a stock-and-flow model of activity: patients flow into the waiting-list (‘stock’), are treated or removed (‘outflow’), and the model tracks how these stocks evolve under different demand and capacity conditions.

The second repository contains a packaged shiny app that calls on the main model, allowing users to experiment with different scenarios without having to change parameters in code.

## Project status

**Status: {{< meta status >}}**

**Rationale:** This work has been undertaken by an experienced team of modellers. There is excellent documentation and good automated test coverage.
However, it is not yet available on CRAN, requiring the code to be installed from GitHub, so it has not undertaken the review process that packages on CRAN go through.
