"{NHSRwaitinglist} is an R package implementing the waiting list management approach described in the paper Understanding Waiting Lists Pressures by Fong et al (2022). The methodology is presented by Neil Walton, Professor in Operations Management at Durham University Business School. The package is being contributed to by members of the NHS-R Community, with the aim of making it simpler for NHS analysts to adopt these methods for the analysis of their own waiting lists."

"At its most basic, the package can be used to simulate a waiting list (a dataframe of waiting list addition dates and removal dates), and then compute some important statistics. Of course, if you already have waiting list data ready to analyse, you can skip the simulation step in the code below." ([source](https://github.com/chrismainey/NHSRwaitinglist))
