    DES RAP Book is an open resource and website for building discrete-event simulation (DES) models within a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP), supporting the healthcare simulation community. The resource demonstrates practical, code-based workflows and tools to help researchers and practitioners develop, validate, and share DES models in Python (SimPy) and R (simmer), ensuring models are reproducible.
