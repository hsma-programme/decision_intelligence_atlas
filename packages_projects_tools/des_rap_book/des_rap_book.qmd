  abstract: |
    DES RAP Book is an open resource and website for building discrete-event simulation (DES) models within a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP), supporting the healthcare simulation community. The resource demonstrates practical, code-based workflows and tools to help researchers and practitioners develop, validate, and share DES models in Python (SimPy) and R (simmer), ensuring models are reproducible.

This practical guide shows you how to build reproducible **discrete-event simulation models** (DES) that fit into a **reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP)**, with tips that benefit all types of models and analysis.

Key features include:

* **Dual Implementation:** Every concept is demonstrated with working code examples in both Python (SimPy) and R (simmer), allowing you to learn in your preferred language.

* **Example repositories:** The book includes practical case studies like M/M/s queueing models and a stroke capacity planning model, implementing all the book recommendations and available as separate GitHub repositories.

* **Built on Research:** Follows recommendations from peer-reviewed research on reproducibility in healthcare DES, and the NHS RAP Community of Practice Levels of RAP.

* **Interactive Learning:** Structured as a Quarto website with searchable content, code examples you can copy, and clear explanations suitable for beginners through advanced users.
