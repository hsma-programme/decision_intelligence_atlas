Package to support discrete-event simulation (DES) and monte-carlo simulation education and applied simulation research. Features:

1. Implementation of classic Optimisation via Simulation procedures such as KN, KN++, OBCA and OBCA-m

2. Theoretical and empirical distributions module that includes classes that encapsulate a random number stream, seed, and distribution parameters.

3. An extendable Distribution registry that provides a quick reproduible way to parameterise simulation models.

4. Implementation of Thinning to sample from Non-stationary Poisson Processes (time-dependent) in a DES.

5. Automatic selection of the number of replications to run via the Replications Algorithm.

6. EXPERIMENTAL: model trace functionality to support debugging of simulation models.
