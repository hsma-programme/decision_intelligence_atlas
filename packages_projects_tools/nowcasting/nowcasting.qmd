    Nowcasting uses real-time data and statistical modelling to estimate what is happening right now — before all information has fully arrived. In healthcare, it helps anticipate short-term trends such as hospital admissions or bed occupancy, enabling faster, data-informed operational decisions even when reporting delays or incomplete data make the current situation unclear.

Nowcasting combines statistical modelling with real-time data to estimate current levels of activity when complete information is not yet available. Originally used in fields like economics and epidemiology, it also has potential application in healthcare operations.

This script was used during the COVID-19 pandemic. In it, nowcasting methods were used to predict near-term hospital admissions and bed occupancy despite delays in data reporting. By accounting for those delays, nowcasting provided more accurate, up-to-date estimates of system pressure than raw data alone. This approach supports operational planning and resource allocation, helping healthcare teams respond proactively to emerging trends rather than reacting to outdated figures.

>  As a near-term forecasting approach, the ‘nowcasts’ predict COVID-19 bed occupancy rates for the following 7 days using trends in recent data. One of the advantages of this method is that each prediction does not require data from any factors other than that being measured. The forecasts are produced using the time series model with the lowest cross-validation error. This may either be a fitted exponential smoothing state space model or a fitted autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.

While it is a comparatively simple approach with its limitations, it does have its uses. A full read of the [paper](https://doi.org/10.12968/bjhc.2020.0179) is recommended to understand this method and whether it is suitable for your use case, or whether alternative forecasting options would be better suited to the problem at hand.
