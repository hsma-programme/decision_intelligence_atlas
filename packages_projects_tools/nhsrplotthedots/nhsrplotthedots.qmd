NHSrplotthedots is an R package designed to make it easier to produce statistical process control (SPC) charts, which are a widely well-regarded way to report on KPIs in trusts and other organisations across the country.

Pairing well with reporting tools like Quarto or rmarkdown, as well as dashboarding tools like R Shiny, this battle-tested package used in trusts across the country can help to automate and improve reporting, using the same underlying methodology as the Excel tool originally provided by the

## The Making Data Count Programme
