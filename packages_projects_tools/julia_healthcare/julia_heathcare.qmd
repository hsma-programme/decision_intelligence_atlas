The website covers some examples of Julia programming for healthcare optimisation and simulation. This includes:

* Healthcare routing and scheduling problems.
* Multi-objective optimisation.
* Local search metaheuristics.
* Parallel computing capabilities.
* Discrete-event simulation using SimJulia.
