This is a "hybrid simulation model that combines a System Dynamics (SD) model with a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model. The SD model is used to model patient deterioration while waiting for a General Practitioner (GP) referral in Primary Care, and the DES model is used to model the patient journey through an Orthopaedic department." ([source](https://github.com/MHowells/HybridSimModel))

This work was presented at The OR Society's 12th Simulation Workshop (SW25) conference. Poster embedded below is from [github.com/MHowells/SW25_poster](https://github.com/MHowells/SW25_poster).

## Project status

**Status: {{< meta status >}}**

**Rationale:** The code is well organised and thoughtfully designed with reuse in mind, but there remains room for improvement, such as testing and more comprehensive documentation.
