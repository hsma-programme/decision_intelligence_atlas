## Behind the Atlas

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='70%'}

The Atlas was started by [Sammi Rosser](https://www.sammirosser.com), an ex NHS data scientist, who is now a trainer on the [Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA)](www.hsma.co.uk) programme, teaching analysts, managers and clinicians how to program and use advanced techniques to improve health services. Finding it challenging to keep up with the endless number of webinars, newsletters, conferences and more necessary to keep abreast of projects and techniques of interest, she started the Atlas to provide the resource she wished she'd had from day 1 in her NHS data career.

The HSMA programme teaches programming in Python, data science and operational research techniques to analysts, data scientists, clinicians and more! The programme provides training on a lot of the advanced techniques mentioned in the Atlas, as well as how to write code so you can confidently use the great Python packages that the Atlas compiles.

While the full programme, which also includes live access to the sessions and project mentoring support, is only available to those working in public health and social care organisations, all previous [session recordings, slides, example code](https://hsma.co.uk/hsma_content/modules/modules.html) and [eBooks](https://hsma.co.uk/hsma_content/books/books.html) are available on the [HSMA website](https://hsma.co.uk/).
