There are lots of ways to contribute to the Atlas - and many don't involve code or a lot of your time!

We want - and need - this to be a project written for the community, by the community. So please don't be afraid to get stuck in - we're a friendly bunch and want to make the contribution process as easy as possible.

## Submit an idea for an entry

Heard of a project, package or tool you think the Atlas should showcase?

Think there's a graph type you think should be shared with the community? Even better, do you have a reproducible code snippet to make that graph?

Or what about an advanced analysis, data science or operational research technique you think we should include?

You don't have to write the full thing - just [submit an issue](https://github.com/hsma-programme/decision_intelligence_atlas/issues/new/choose) on the Atlas's GitHub repository.

Don't worry about accidentally submitting a duplicate - we'd rather hear about something ten times than not at all! But if you'd like to take a look, you can see all of the currently proposed entries in our GitHub project.

## Write an entry

### Without code

Want to write some entries for us, but not confident working with GitHub and Quarto (the framework we build the site with)? No problem! We have a totally code free route to writing Atlas entries.

Follow [this link](https://github.com/hsma-programme/decision_intelligence_atlas/issues/new/choose) to submit an issue on the Atlas's GitHub repository.

Choose 'New Package, Project or Tool Submission'

You'll then be provided with a form to gather the information we need to create a new Atlas entry - no code required.

With a bit of GitHub actions wizardry, your form will be translated into the format the website need. A member of the Atlas team will then review this file and make any necessary tweaks before incorporating it into the site.

:::{.callout-note}
At the moment, it's only possible to contribute a package, project or tool in this way.

We may add the option to contribute techniques or graph catalogue entries in this way in the future - check back or let us know if this is something you'd be interested in.

### With code

Like working with Quarto, or want to give it a try?

Head over to the [instructions in our GitHub readme](https://github.com/hsma-programme/decision_intelligence_atlas?tab=readme-ov-file#advanced-option-contributing-a-qmd-file) for details of how you can contribute to the Atlas via making a pull request on GitHub.
